Wezolo
======
This was our Dev Bootcamp final project. It's a social network and discovery site for the Peace Corps.

Check it out at [wezolo.com](http://wezolo.com)

Note: This repo is just a placeholder. The project is still being updated and maintained at the [original repo](https://github.com/samsamskies/wezolo).

## Main features include:
* Peek into the daily life of a Peace Corps volunteer with our “What’s Going On?” newsfeed. Our feed is populated by our users’ Blogger/Blogspot and Tumblr blogs.
* Easily search for other users by name, location, country of service, and service sector.
* Ask questions and receive answers via SMS with our “Volunteer Questions” tool. This tool is mainly for users that are stuck in villages with no internet connection.

Wezolo
======
This was our Dev Bootcamp final project. It's a social network and discovery site for the Peace Corps.

Check it out at [wezolo.com](http://wezolo.com)

## Main features include:
* Peek into the daily life of a Peace Corps volunteer with our “What’s Going On?” newsfeed. Our feed is populated by our users’ Blogger/Blogspot and Tumblr blogs.
* Easily search for other users by name, location, country of service, and service sector.
* Ask questions and receive answers via SMS with our “Volunteer Questions” tool. This tool is mainly for users that are stuck in villages with no internet connection.

## Contributing to the project:

1. Fork the repo

2. Build a feature on your own branch. i.e git branch <branchname>

3. Write some tests, ideally between 1-10 per feature. You decide how many before you ask us to pull, we decide if your feature is dangerous or not.

4. Have a sense of humor and realize that you just contributed to an open source project. High five!
